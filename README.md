This project demonstrates a complete Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline using Jenkins, GitHub, and Robot Framework.
It is designed to automatically trigger test executions whenever a new push is made to the GitHub repository.

The goal is to automate the testing process in real-time, generate clear test reports, and lay the foundation for integrating with more advanced DevOps practices such as notifications, artifact archiving, and deployment automation.

This project is ideal for those working in network testing, QA automation, or DevOps, especially in environments involving IP networks or SDN infrastructures.
